************ VERFYING DC GAIN OF THE CLOSED LOOP NEGATIVE CIRCUIT *************

***********THEORY***************
For the verifying DC Gain...
We give a DC input of 1 in ngspice.
DC gain = Vout/Vin (for DC value of input)
Since Vin=1 
Dc gain = Vout

***********SIMULATION************
We write the commands in the specified format in ngspice.
Now set the simulation to .op (operating point) (NOTE:- SINCE WE ARE DOING DC ANALYSIS)
always end the netlist with .end command

***********VERIFYING***************
We can notice that V(vo)= 9.9903
But the calculated value of DC gain is 10(mentioned in the pdf).

***********ERROR ANALYSIS**********
ERROR in DC GAIN = 10-9.993 = 0.007
Thus, the predicted value in ngspice is almost accurate.
